This is an external package for esphome to add support for the ads1110 ADC chip (as used in e.g. the m5stack ADC I2C Unit v1.1).

Developed using as references the ADS1110 driver from nadavmatalon (https://github.com/nadavmatalon/ADS1110), the ADS1115 driver from realthunder (https://github.com/realthunder/esphome-ads1115) and the TI datasheet (https://www.ti.com/lit/gpn/ads1110).
